In this code:

We download historical EUR/USD forex data from Yahoo Finance from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021.

We calculate daily returns and use the previous day's return as a feature for prediction.

We split the data into training and testing sets.

We create and train a simple linear regression model.

We make predictions on the test set and calculate performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

We plot the actual vs. predicted returns for visualization.
